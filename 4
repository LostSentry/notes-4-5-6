list = ordered collection of items, flexible unlike array, can be empty
3 types: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
Arraylist starts empty and is filled from 0 up
null = empty value
items moved up or down to take the space of something removed/ shifted by something added to it
to take something out: ArrayName.remove("String you want removed") || ArrayName.remove(0); by index num
ArrayName.size(); tells you the size

LinkedList: nodes linked together, node = 1 list item, each node links to node before/after, knows start/end but can't access middle directly
Go through the chain until you find the link you want
break links to insert a new item between them to chain again
vectors: use an array to store internally but synchronized, slower than array list, GUI
lists contain 1 type of data: strings or doubles or ints etc <>
have to use full word when creating lists: Integer, Boolean, Double
