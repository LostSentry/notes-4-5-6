Several different library classes for file input and output or I/O
different circumstances
-read byte by byte/character by character/line by line?
-reading, writing, appending?
-sequentially or random?
-text or binary?

Steps for writing to a file
1. create and open a file for writing, OR open an existing file to add data
2. Write data
3. close the file

FileWriter and BufferedWriter
FileWriter: open, create, close, and write to a file. can write out Strings/chars to a file
if a file does exist it will be overwritten
use append flag to prevent overwrite
File I/O is slower than reading/writing to memory
BufferedWriter handles I/O in the background so mem-based ops can continue while the file is being used

Writing ints
ints are interpreted as unicode values
if you want to write an int it must be converted to a string "65"

BufferedReader to wrap a FileReader
to read an entire file use a while loop that repeats while readLine () != null
